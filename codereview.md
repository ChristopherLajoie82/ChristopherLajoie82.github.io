## Artifacts Reviewed

### Paint Tracking System (Original)
- **Lines of Code**: ~400
- **Architecture**: Monolithic
- **Issues Identified**:
  - All logic in single file
  - No error handling
  - No input validation
  - Missing security features

### Planned Enhancements

#### Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design
- Implement PySide6/Qt6 GUI
- Three-layer architecture
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security features

#### Enhancement Two: Algorithms & Data Structures
- Industry-standard mixing ratios
- Optimized calculation algorithms
- Data validation

#### Enhancement Three: Databases

## Code Review Summary

This comprehensive code review analyzes the original Paint Tracking System and identifies critical areas for improvement across three key categories. The review demonstrates my ability to:

- Critically evaluate existing code architecture
- Identify security vulnerabilities and design flaws
- Plan systematic improvements using industry best practices
- Apply software engineering principles to legacy code

The findings from this review directly informed the three enhancement implementations for my capstone project, transforming a basic 400-line application into a professional, secure, and scalable system.
